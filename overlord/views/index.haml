        %h2 Hello, bomb technician.
        %p SECURITY WARNING: This bomb is currently disarmed. Once armed, there are three extremely tedious and difficult ways to disarm it again (so you might as well not try):
        %ol
          %li Hack into each of the 6 panels on the bomb by entering the codes.
          %li Enter the super secret disarm code that only The Overlord knows.
          %li 
            Simply 
            %b [CLASSIFIED] 
            until 
            %b [REDACTED].
        %p Oh yeah, and if you're going to hack into the panels make sure you freshen up on your binary first so you can hack them on your first try! Otherwise each unsuccessful attempt takes 10 seconds off the timer. Once the bomb has been hacked, it cannot be armed again. Good luck, the fate of our world (and universe) is in your hands...muhahahahaha.
