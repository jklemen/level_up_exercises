## RedditCast
An app that lets you create TV channels for your different interests, and displays a stream of relevant videos from reddit on each of those channels.

Like cats? Make Channel 5 your "Cats" channel.
Like electronic music? Make Channel 47 the "Electro" channel.

RedditCast has several features:

 * Log into the app on your computer and on a mobile device to use the device as a remote.
 * Enter a search query to get a customized channel
 * Skip to the next or previous show on a channel with ease.
 * Set a show to repeat indefinitely for those rick-rolls, tv-fireplaces, and catchy songs.
 * View a guide to see what's playing next and what has already played.
 * No commercials!

And of course, if you just want a feed of videos from a particular subreddit or multireddit, you can do that too.

Like most cable services (and like Reddit), RedditCast will come with a default set of channels to let you start watching right away.

This app was inspired by [Reddit TV](http://www.reddit.tv).
